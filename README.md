Crime Data Analysis
This project analyzes crime data to identify temporal and demographic patterns in criminal activity.
Key Analyses
Crime by Hour: Visualized the distribution of crimes by hour using a count plot.
Peak Crime Hour: Identified the hour with the highest number of reported crimes.
Night Crime Analysis: Filtered crimes occurring during night hours (10 PM–3 AM) and determined the area with the highest night crime volume.
Victim Age Distribution: Categorized victims into age brackets and summarized the frequency of crimes by age group.
Requirements
Python (with pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook
Usage
Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
